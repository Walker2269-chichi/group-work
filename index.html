HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. Here are some basic concepts:

1. HTML Structure
Doctype Declaration: <!DOCTYPE html> indicates the document type.
HTML Element: <html> is the root element.
Head Element: <head> contains meta-information (like title and links to styles).
Body Element: <body> contains the content displayed on the page.
2. Elements and Tags
Tags: Elements are defined using tags, like <h1>, <p>, or <div>.
Opening and Closing Tags: Most elements have an opening tag (<tag>) and a closing tag (</tag>).
Self-Closing Tags: Some tags donâ€™t need a closing tag, like <img /> or <br />.
3. Common HTML Elements
Headings: <h1> to <h6> for headings.
Paragraphs: <p> for paragraphs.
Links: <a href="url"> for hyperlinks.
Images: <img src="image.jpg" alt="description" /> for images.
Lists: <ul> (unordered list), <ol> (ordered list), and <li> (list item).
4. Attributes
Elements can have attributes that provide additional information, like:
src for image sources in <img>
href for link destinations in <a>
class and id for styling and scripting.
5. Nesting Elements
Elements can be nested within each other, such as placing a <p> tag inside a <div> tag.
6. Comments
Comments are added using <!-- comment --> and are not displayed in the browser.
7. Semantic HTML
Using HTML elements that convey meaning (like <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>) improves accessibility and SEO.
8. HTML Forms
Forms collect user input using elements like <input>, <textarea>, <select>, and <button>.
9. HTML Entities
Special characters can be represented using HTML entities, like &nbsp; for a non-breaking space or &lt; for a less-than sign.
10. HTML5
The latest version of HTML, which includes new features like <video>, <audio>, and enhanced support for web applications.
